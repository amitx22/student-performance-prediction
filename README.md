 # 🎓 Student Performance Prediction – Machine Learning Capstone

This project predicts **student math performance** and **overall pass/fail outcome** using demographic and academic features.  
It includes a complete end-to-end pipeline:

✔ Data Cleaning  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Feature Engineering  
✔ ML Model Building (Regression + Classification)  
✔ Model Evaluation  
✔ Streamlit Web App Deployment

## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Education  
- Lunch type  
- Test Preparation course  
- Math Score  
- Reading Score  
- Writing Score  

**Goals of the project:**

### 1️⃣ Predict **Math Score** (Regression)  
Models used:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor (Best)

### 2️⃣ Predict **Pass/Fail** (Classification)  
Logic: If `(Math + Reading + Writing)/3 >= 60 → Pass`

Models used:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier (Best)

### 3️⃣ Deploy ML model as a Web App  
Using **Streamlit** with real-time predictions.
